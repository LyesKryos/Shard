This is the declaration of acknowledgement of border claims and the mutual assurance of respect. 
The Empire of Bassiliya and the Kingdom of Cisalpine and Switzerland mutually agree to respect the borders and claims of both empires fully and completely (claims outlined in this message: https://discord.com/channels/674259612580446230/974663465115451474/975118608697032714). South and west of the indicated line (including the line itself) will be reserved for Bassiliya; north and east of the line will be reserved for Cisalpine.  Each empire will agree to take no action against the other, as long as that other empire is pursuing agreed-upon claims and not taking direct action against any signatory. This agreement will last until the 100th turn or until the claim agreements of both empires are fully realized. Any signatory that wishes to break the agreement will notify the other signatories 10 turns in advance and surrender 5% of their current resources or their current income, whichever is greater, to the other signatories.
