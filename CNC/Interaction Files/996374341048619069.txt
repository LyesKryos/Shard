The Confederacy of Sounor never intended or planned to invade Revamper, with whom she has no quarrel. She seeks only for retribution against the dastardly Eyaxians who attacked her without provocation or justified reason. It is only fair that they be subject to the same pains and suffering as they inflict upon others. Sounor calls for an immediate peace, and extends the invitation to Revamper to join the Confederacy in punishing the greatest evil this world has seen.
