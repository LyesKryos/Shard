The Republic of Arnding agrees to lease the province of Behzum (24) for one turn in exchange for 290, double it's worth. If the province is not returned by next turn or the resources not paid, the Arding-Felix alliance will be immediately terminated, and Felix Femboi will be required to pay the 50,000 termination cost.
