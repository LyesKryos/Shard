The nation of Tok'hamat would like to show its support against an unsolicited attack on Arnding. Although there is a justification used by some nations which includes helping Crea, this is an undiplomatic solution to a preventable war. Had Jaedonstan, Crea Kudel and Renaria looked to have a diplomatic solution with Arnding, then the three nations would've had the full support of the good people, yet they didn't. They attacked on grounds that are shaky and thin. Thus, the nation of Tok'hamat would like to show their full support for Arnding unless an attempt at peace, which is not overly harsh, is made.
