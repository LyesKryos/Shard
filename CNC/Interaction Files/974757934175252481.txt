You are formally invited to the Confederacy of Global Prosperity, a greater alliance pact dedicated to cooperation between like-minded nations and defense from external forces. Any nation inside this alliance must not host any force of agression against other members. Members are free to pursue external interests. In the case of a war involving a member, the CGP will decide the joint response. Nations in the alliance also are encouraged to cooperate with each other.
