The Holy Kingdom of Cisalpine proposes an extensive alliance and trade agreement. If accepted, our 2 nations will not conduct any form of aggression against one another, and must allow trade to run freely. Depending on the situation an attack on one of our nations may result in the other joining, although this is dependent on the situation.
