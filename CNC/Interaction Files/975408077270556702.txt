The nation of Felix Femboi and Nokoroth will agree on the borders as described ( https://imgur.com/a/nITmMmj ) with a payment of 40,000 resources from Felix Femboi to Nokoroth when all described territories are under the jurisdiction of both of the nations. The two nations of Felix Femboi and Nokoroth shall agree on a non-aggression treaty independently of any alliances which will last until Turn 100 or indefinitely unless explicitly cancelled. Any war towards allies will result in it being broken. Premature braking of this treaty other than the above mentioned reason will result in a 50,000 resource fine from the offending nation.
