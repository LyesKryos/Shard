The Grand Duchy of Eyax offers this alliance with The United Isles of Felix Femboi as a act of friendship of non-agression, trade agreement and open borders. This alliance will last until 100 at the least and it will continue indefinitely unless explicitly cancelled. Premature braking of this treaty other than the above mentioned reason will result in a 50,000 resource fine from the offending nation without an 10 turn warning. It is currently turn #13
