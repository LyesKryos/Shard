The Duchy of Eyax shall welcome the Republic of Arnding to the Tricontinent Alliance Organization.

The TAO is a mutual defence treaty that ensures the independence and sovereignty of all member states. Any member of the TAO who is attacked by an outside force will immediately be supported, both directly and indirectly, in the defence of their homeland. The TAO will ensure the defence of its members and their claims. Any war waged with the just cause of ensuring the safety and prosperity of a member nation and with the aim of taking control of core territory may be declared on any non-signatory. The TAO may elect to join the war on the side of the attacker. This vote shall be decided by simple majority, each member state having a single vote. Any member may leave the alliance at any time, with no repercussions from any other member state. Any other state may join the TAO, but must be approved by a simple majority vote of all members.
